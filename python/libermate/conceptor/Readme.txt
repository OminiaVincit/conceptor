This is the Matlab code companion to the paper

H. Jaeger, Controlling Recurrent Neural Networks by Conceptors, Jacobs University technical report Nr 31, March 2014

The folder "Matlab" contains all the code that was used for the simulations documented in the report. Matlab script files whose names start with "fig..." produce a simulation run and graphical output corresponding to the material presented in the corresponding figure in the report. Each of these files provides a stand-alone executable simulation. Matlab files not starting with "fig..." are helper files that are called by the "fig..." scripts. 

The code was created under Matlab release 2008B, but I believe Matlab is generally backward-compatible and I do not expect problems when the scripts are run with more recent versions of Matlab.

The script files are my "work-in-progress" raw files and are only sparsely commented. No support will be given. Only when parts of this monster-sized technical report will be published in a peer-reviewed journal, I will produce cleaned-up and nicely documented code and make it public.
